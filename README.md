# osu-server-beatmap-submission

Handles submitting new and updating existing beatmaps to the [osu! website.](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

## Running

### Development

This configuration permits full-stack integration testing with other local osu! services.
To run the project in this configuration, you must have a configured [`osu-web` instance](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/blob/master/SETUP.md).
Additionally, to test beatmap downloads, you may want to set up a local beatmap mirror; see [`osu-beatmap-mirror-docker-runtime`](https://github.com/ThePooN/osu-beatmap-mirror-docker-runtime) for more information.

1. [Set up a client key](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/blob/master/SETUP.md#use-the-api-from-osu) that will be used to identify users. It should be the same client key that the osu!(lazer) client uses to communicate with `osu-web`.
2. In [`launchSettings.json`](osu.Server.BeatmapSubmission/Properties/launchSettings.json), in the `fullstack` configuration, set the following environment variables:
   - Set `JWT_VALID_AUDIENCE` to the client ID assigned to the key created in step (1).
   - Set `LOCAL_BEATMAP_STORAGE_PATH` to a directory where submitted beatmaps should be placed.
3. Copy the `osu-web` OAuth public key to the `osu.Server.BeatmapSubmission` project root:
   ```
   $ cp osu-web/storage/oauth-public.key osu-server-beatmap-submission/osu.Server.BeatmapSubmission/oauth-public.key
   ```
4. Start the project in the `fullstack` configuration.
5. The application will start at http://localhost:5089.
   - When interacting with endpoints which require authorisation, every request must include an `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` header. That token must be a token issued by `osu-web` for the client key set up in step (1).

## Environment variables

For advanced testing purposes.

This project supports three environment setups.
The choice of the environment is steered by the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable.
Depending on environment, the configuration & config requirements change slightly.

- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`:
  - Developer exception pages & API docs (`/api-docs`) are enabled.
  - Sentry & Datadog integrations are optional.
- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Staging`:
   - Developer exception pages & API docs are disabled.
   - Sentry integration is mandatory.
   - Datadog integration is optional.
- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`:
   - Developer exception pages & API docs are disabled.
   - Sentry & Datadog integrations are mandatory.
